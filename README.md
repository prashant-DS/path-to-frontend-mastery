# Path to Frontend Mastery

  Documenting my journey from junior to senior frontend engineer. Real lessons, real mistakes, real growth.

  ## Why This Exists

  I'm tired of forgetting the hard lessons I learn. This is my attempt to write things down as I figure them out.

  If it helps someone else, cool. If not, at least future me will thank present me.

  ## What's Inside

  - Things I wish I knew earlier
  - Patterns that actually worked in production
  - Mistakes I won't make twice
  - Deep dives when I get curious

  ## Status

  Work in progress. Always will be.
